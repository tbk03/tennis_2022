After 30 years or so of watching tennis, I had a hunch that the top level of the sport was becoming slightly more open to players from outside the very richest countries. After a lot of data cleaning and data wrangling (around 800 lines of code) I came up with the chart above. It shows that the dominance of Grand Slam tennis by the richest 20% of countries has indeed declined.

To produce the chart, I needed data on the women's and men's singles entrants for each Grand Slam tournament over the last 30 plus year. This came from the excellent [Tennis Abstract](https://github.com/JeffSackmann).I also needed data on the wealth of countries. This came from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=chart).

In the rest of this R notebook, I go through the data cleaning that helped me to create the chart. I used a range of techniques and approaches, including:
- Reading in multiple csvs and combining the data.
- Tidying data.
- Identifying and imputing missing data.
- Dealing with issues arising from joining data from different sources.
- Web scraping. 
- Using a functional programming approach to generate multiple exploratory plots.

```
## The Tennis Data

I started with reading in the raw tennis data for github. This includes match results for tournaments going back to 1920. The results are stored in two separate repos, one for the women's tour (wta) and one for the men's tour (atp). Then the matches for each year are stored in separate csvs. As a starting point, the code below creates a single dataframe of all these results.

```{r}
#' Get WTA or ATP tour match results from the Tennis Abstract github for the specified year (https://github.com/JeffSackmann)
#'
#' @param year an integer. The earliest years where there are data: wta 1920; atp 1968.
#' @param tour a string either 'wta' or 'atp'
#'
#' @return a dataframe of match results 

get_res <- function(year, tour){

  # form file location string based on year and tour
  repo_url <- glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_{tour}/master/")
  file_name <- glue::glue("{tour}_matches_{year}.csv")
  file_location <- str_c(repo_url, file_name)
  #browser()

  # read in data from csv on github
  res_year <- read_csv(file_location,
                      
                      # address issue with column type being read differently
                      # in different files
                      col_types = list(winner_seed = col_double(),
                                         loser_seed = col_double(),
                                       draw_size = col_double())) %>% 
    
    # make variable names consistent
    janitor::clean_names() %>%

    # add identifiers
    mutate(tour = tour, 
           year = year)

  return(res_year)
}

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# download results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

start_year <- 1968
end_year <-  2022

# aggregate atp results into a single dataframe
atp_results <- seq(start_year, end_year) %>% 
  map_df(~get_res(., "atp"))

# aggregate wta results into a single dataframe
wta_results <- seq(start_year, end_year) %>% 
  map_df(~get_res(., "wta"))

# show the data structure in the notebook
head(arrange(atp_results, tourney_date))
head(arrange(wta_results, tourney_date))

```
## Tidying the data

After a quick look at the dataframes it was clear to me that the data was not in a [tidy form](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html). Actually, it is untidy in some pretty interesting ways. Single variables are split across two columns. For example, `winner_age` and `loser_age` actual a single variable `age`. It is the same for the players nationalities which are split across two columns `winner_ioc` and `loser_ioc`.

In the process of tidying the data,  each observation in the datframe becomes one players participation in one match. This makes things much easier later on. In the raw data observations are the matches themselves.


```{r}
#' Get observations relating to either match winners or losers from 
#' tennis abstract match raw result data
#'
#' @param raw_results_df a dataframe of tennis abstract match result raw data
#' @param result specifies whether `winner` or `loser`data should be returned
#'
#' @return a dataframe of match data for either winners or losers

get_data_by_result <- function(raw_results_df, result){
  
  res_to_retain <- result
  
  if(res_to_retain == "winner"){
    res_to_retain_suffix <- "w_"
    res_to_drop <- "loser"
    res_to_drop_suffix <- "l_"
  }
  
  else if (res_to_retain == "loser"){
    res_to_retain_suffix <- "l_"
    res_to_drop <- "winner"
    res_to_drop_suffix <- "w_"
  }
  
  # tidy up data for match losers
  raw_results_df %>%

    # drop columns containing match stats of the winner
    select(-c(starts_with(res_to_drop), starts_with(res_to_drop_suffix))) %>%

    # simplify column naming to enable row binding of winners and losers
    rename_with(.fn = ~str_replace( .x, str_c(res_to_retain, "_"), ""),
                .cols = starts_with(res_to_retain)) %>%
    rename_with(.fn = ~str_replace( .x, res_to_retain_suffix, ""),
                .cols = starts_with(res_to_retain_suffix)) %>%

    # add result column and match_id
    mutate(result = res_to_retain,
           match_id = 1:n(),
           match_id_str = str_c(match_id, tour, year, sep = "_"),
           .after = name)
  
}


#' Puts tennis abstract match raw result data in a tidy form
#'
#' @param raw_results_df a dataframe of tennis abstract match result raw data
#'
#' @return a tidy dataframe of tennis abstract match results data

tidy_match_results <- function(raw_results_df){
  
  losers <- get_data_by_result(raw_results_df, "loser")
  winners <- get_data_by_result(raw_results_df, "winner")
  
  results_tidy <- 
    
    # recombine data on winning and losing players
    bind_rows(losers, winners) %>% 
    
    # order for readability
    arrange(year, tour, match_id) %>% 
    
    # convert variable types where needed
    mutate(tourney_date = lubridate::ymd(tourney_date))
  
  return(results_tidy)
}

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# tidy results
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

atp_results_tidy <- tidy_match_results(atp_results)
wta_results_tidy <- tidy_match_results(wta_results)

# create single dataframe with results from both tours
all_results_tidy <- bind_rows(
  atp_results_tidy, wta_results_tidy
)

```

After all that tidying, we have a single dataframe with all the results, men's and women's singles. The first few lines of the data look like this.

```{r}
head(all_results_tidy)
```


### Focussing in on the relevant data

Up until this point, I had been working with data relating to all tennis matches. For the data visualisations I was making I only needed Grand Slam results. So, now was the time to focus in. Even more specifically, I only needed a few details about the players appearing in the first round of Grand Slam tournaments. The code chunk below got me to where I wanted to be. 

```{r}
results_focused <- all_results_tidy %>% 
  
  # focus on entrants to grand slam tournaments
  filter(tourney_level == "G") %>% 
  
  # focus on variables of interest
  select(year, tourney_name, tour, name, id, 
         country_code = ioc) %>% 
  
  # remove duplicates where players have appeared in multiple rounds 
  unique()

# show the structure of the data
head(results_focused)
```

### Check completeness of data

I had wanted to look at the dominance of Grand Slams by players from the richest countries from the start of the Open Era (1969). Unfortunately, I couldn't do that as I ran into some missing data issues.

I had assumed there had always been 128 players in the first round of each singles draw. So a total of 256 players at each Grand Slam.In the code chunk below, I looked at the number of singles players for each tournament as a way of identify missing data. I saw some tournaments with fewer than 256 players before 1989. Checking online records for some of these tournaments, I could see that some did indeed have men's or women's draws with less than 128 entrants. Rather than manually checking number of players at the apparently smaller tournaments are correct, I decided to refine the scope of the analysis to look at Grand Slam tournaments from 1990 onwards. The code below also confirms that all post 1990 tournaments have 256 singles players. 


```{r}
# look for missing data in post 1968 results
results_focused %>% 
  count(year, tourney_name) %>% 
  filter(n != 256)

# focus on Grand Slams from 1990 onwards
results_clean <- results_focused %>% 
  filter(year >= 1990) %>% 
  
  # correct and issue with tournament names being different for the US Open 
  # Men's and Women's Singles in 2019.
  mutate(tourney_name = replace(tourney_name, 
                                tourney_name == "Us Open",
                                "US Open"))

# confirm there is no missing data for Grand Slams 1990 onwards
num_missing <- results_clean %>% 
  count(year, tourney_name) %>% 
  filter(n != 256) %>% 
  nrow()

assertthat::assert_that(num_missing == 0)
```
That is about it for cleaning the tennis data for now. Before moving on to the data on the wealth of countries since 1990, here is how the first few observations of the clean tennis data look. I'm not sure why Michael Brown has `B395` as part of his name! But I didn't the player names for my chart, so I didn't need to worry about that too much.

```{r}
head(results_clean)
```


## GDP data

The data I used on the wealth of countries was GDP per capita data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=chart). The GDP per capita was much more straight-forward, than the tennis result data, to read in and tidy. It is all done in the code chunk below. The main thing to note is that the data included geographical entities that are not individual countries, such as continents and regions.

```{r}
gdp_focus <- read_csv("data/gdp-per-capita-worldbank.csv") %>% 
  
  # make variable names consistent
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # rename variables to make them easier to work with 
  rename(gdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita_ppp_constant_2017_international,
         country = entity,
         country_code = code) %>% 
  
  # focus on 1990 onwards in line with Grand Slam entrant data
  filter(year >= 1990)

# remove entities which are not countries (e.g. regions or continents)
# i.e. those which do not have country codes
non_country_entities <- gdp_focus %>% 
  filter(is.na(country_code)) %>% 
  distinct(country) %>% 
  .$country

gdp_focus <- gdp_focus %>% 
  filter(!country %in% non_country_entities) %>% 
  filter(country != "World")
  
  
```
### Check completeness of data

On first glance there is no missing data for GDP per capita, there are no NAs in the dataframe. However, I wanted to check for implicitly missing data. In this case that would be missing year-country combinations. Here I did pick up some implicitly missing data.

```{r}
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# explore explicitly missing data
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
visdat::vis_miss(gdp_focus) +
  labs(title = "No explicitly missing data")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# explore implicitly missing data
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# create a dataframe with all combinations of year and country
gdp_focus_exp_grid <-  expand_grid(country = unique(gdp_focus$country),
            year = unique(gdp_focus$year)) %>%
  
  # add in gdp data where available
  left_join(gdp_focus)

# show implicitly missing data
gdp_missing <- gdp_focus_exp_grid %>% 
  filter(is.na(gdp_per_capita))

visdat::vis_miss(gdp_focus_exp_grid) +
  labs(title = "But there is implicitly missing data")

gdp_missing

```

### Exploring and imputing missing data

From initial inspection of the data (see chunk below), it looked like where GDP per capita data missing for a country, it was missing for a number of years starting at 1990 and then followed by complete data up until 2020. 

```{r}
# look at countries with missing data
gdp_missing %>% 
  count(country)

countries_gdp_missing <- unique(gdp_missing$country)

# look at where the missing data is in each country's time series
gdp_missing %>% 
  arrange(country, year)

p <- gdp_focus_exp_grid %>% 
  
  # only need to plot countries with missing data
  filter(country %in% countries_gdp_missing) %>% 
  
  # create the plot
  ggplot(aes(year, gdp_per_capita, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = 0.8, colour = highlight_colour) +
      
    labs(title = "Countries with missing GDP per capita data",
         subtitle = "Hover over lines to see which countries",
         x = NULL,
         y = "GDP per capita") +
    
    # dollar axis labels
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  
    # adjust y axis title for readability
    theme(axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=10)))

# make interactive with tooltips for data exploration
plotly::ggplotly(p)
  
```

I tried using an interpolation function, from the `zoo` package, to impute the missing data. However, given the data is missing at the start of time series, the was some strange interpolation behaviour. See plot below. 

```{r}
library(zoo)

# select countries to highlight strange interpolation behavior
strange_interpolation <- c("Kosovo", "Cayman Islands", "Iceland")

p <- gdp_focus_exp_grid %>% 
  mutate(
    gdp_per_capita = zoo::na.approx(gdp_per_capita),
    highlight = country %in% strange_interpolation) %>% 
  # only need to plot countries with missing data
  filter(country %in% countries_gdp_missing) %>% 
  
  # create the plot
  ggplot(aes(year, gdp_per_capita, 
             group = country, 
             colour = highlight)) +
    
    geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
    
    scale_colour_manual(values = c("#C7C2C4", highlight_colour)) +
  
    labs(title = "Strange behaviour with interpolation function",
         x = NULL) +
    
    # dollar axis labels
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
    theme(legend.position = "none")

# make interactive with tooltips for data exploration
plotly::ggplotly(p)
```
So, I use a simple interpolation method, based on the pattern of missing data. I assumed that where data was missing for a country, say between 1990 and 1995. I would use the first GDP per capita to fill the gaps for missing years. So, in this example the GDP per capita for 1996 would be used to the fill the missing data gaps between 1990 and 1995. 

```{r}
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# find the earliest record of gdp_per_capita for each country
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

earliest_gdp <- gdp_focus_exp_grid %>% 
  
  # focus on relevant observations
  filter(!is.na(gdp_per_capita),
         country %in% countries_gdp_missing) %>% 
  
  # identify earliest year with gdp_per_cap observation
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(min_year = min(year)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  
  # focus only on each countries earliest year with gdp_per_cap observation
  filter(year == min_year) %>% 
  
  # retain only the columns needed to simplify the join below
  select(earliest_gdp_per_capita = gdp_per_capita,
         country_code,
         country)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# for each country replace missing gdp_per_capita data with earliest 
# gdp_per_cap observation
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

gdp_clean <- gdp_focus_exp_grid %>% 
  
  left_join(earliest_gdp, by = c("country" = "country")) %>% 
  
  # replace nas
  mutate(gdp_per_capita = 
           if_else(
              is.na(gdp_per_capita), 
              earliest_gdp_per_capita, 
              gdp_per_capita
              ),
    
         country_code =
           if_else(
              is.na(country_code.x),
              country_code.y, 
              country_code.x
              )
    ) %>% 
  
  # tidy up dataframe
  arrange(country,year) %>% 
  select(-c(country_code.x, country_code.y, earliest_gdp_per_capita))

```



## Join the two datasets

Having cleaned and reshaped the tennis results and gdp per capita datasets, it was time to join the two datasets together. In both dataset there was a country code (e.g. GBR for Great Britain), so I used this for the join. I wrote a quick function below to test the performance of the join, in terms of how many countries codes were succesfully found in both datasets. Unfortuantely, initial performance of the join was poor, with only 55 of 90 country codes matched.

```{r}

#' Quickly check how well two dataframes join
#'
#' @param df1 the dataframe passed as the first argument to the 
#' @param df2 
#' @param join_func the specific join function to be applied (e.g. left_join)
#' @param ... other parameters to be passed to the join function
#' 
#' @return a vector including the number of observations which are of join successes and failures

join_performance <- function(df1, df2, join_func, ...){
  
  # perform the join
  join <- df1 %>%
    join_func(df2, ...)
  
  # the number of observations which are of join failures
  num_join_miss <- join %>% 
    filter(is.na(gdp_per_capita)) %>% 
    distinct(country_code) %>% 
    nrow()
  
  # the number of observations which are of join successes
  num_join_hit <- join %>% 
    filter(!is.na(gdp_per_capita)) %>% 
    distinct(country_code) %>% 
    nrow()

  # return the number of observations which are of join successes and failures
  c("join_sucesses" = num_join_hit, "join_failures" = num_join_miss)
}

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# prepare the two data frames for joining
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# gdp data only goes up to 2020, so remove 2021 and 2022 match data
results_clean <- filter(results_clean, year <= 2020) %>% 
  # remove any white space ahead of using to join with gdp data
  mutate(country_code = str_trim(country_code, side = "both"))

# remove any white space ahead of using to join with tennis data
gdp_clean <- gdp_clean %>% 
  mutate(country_code = str_trim(country_code, side = "both"))
  
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# look at initial join performance
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
join_performance(results_clean, 
  gdp_clean,left_join)

```

I realised that the two datasets were using different naming standards. ISO codes in the gdp data, and IOC codes for the tennis data. So, I web scraped a lookup table for converting between the two standards from Wikipedia.This improved the join performance considerably, see code output below.

```{r}
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# web scrape a look up table for mapping between iso country codes (gdp data)
# and ioc codes (tennis data)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lookup_raw <- read_html("https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_IOC,_FIFA,_and_ISO_3166_country_codes") %>% 
  html_nodes(xpath="/html/body/div[1]/div/div[4]/main/div[2]/div[3]/div[1]/table[1]") %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  pluck(1)

iso_ioc_lookup <- lookup_raw %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(ioc, iso)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# replace iso country codes in gdp data with ioc codes (as used in tennis data)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

gdp_clean_ioc <- gdp_clean %>% 
  left_join(iso_ioc_lookup,
            by = c("country_code" = "iso"))

# just one country without an ioc code so ignore
gdp_clean_ioc %>% 
  filter(is.na(ioc))

gdp_clean_ioc <- gdp_clean_ioc %>% 
  mutate(country_code = ioc) %>% 
  select(-ioc)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# check if join performance has improved
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

join_performance(results_clean,
                 gdp_clean_ioc,left_join)

```
I thought with a bit of manual intervention, I could probably improve the join performance a little more. So, I took a look at the tennis players (and their nationalities), where it was not possible to match up GDP per capita data.

```{r}
# look at players/countries where no match to gdp data

no_match <- results_clean %>% 
  left_join(gdp_clean_ioc) %>% 
  filter(is.na(gdp_per_capita)) 

no_match %>% 
  distinct(year, name, country_code)

no_match %>% 
  distinct(country_code)

```

I could see that some of the issues related to countries that no longer exist, for example the USSR. As an approximation, I thought where possible these could be replaced with a current and related country, for example Russia. After some manual updates this improved the join performance a little further, and I was happy to call the joined data good enough to work with. For only 5 countries, in the tennis results data, it wasn't possible to match up GDP per capita data. Non of these 5 countries were major tennis playing countries.

```{r}
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Identify predecessor countries and check for the names of countries with 
# no gdp data
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# set up string for searching within country names
country_check <- c("ven" = c("venezuela"),

                   "cub" = c("cuba"),

# combine country search strings into a single regular expression

country_check_str <- str_c(country_check, collapse = "|")

# search strings found in the following countries present in the dataset 
matches_found <- gdp_clean_ioc %>% 
  mutate(country_check = str_detect(str_to_lower(country), country_check_str)) %>% 
  filter(country_check) %>% 
  distinct(country, country_code)
matches_found

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Where possible find a country that approximately matches for countries with 
# no gdp data
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
country_code_replacement_lookup <- matches_found %>% 
  mutate(code_to_replace = c("TCH", "LIE", NA, "URS", "SCG" )) %>% 
  rename(replacement_code = country_code) %>% 
  select(-country) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(code_to_replace)) 

results_clean <- results_clean %>% 
  left_join(country_code_replacement_lookup, 
            by = c("country_code" = "code_to_replace")) %>% 
  mutate(country_code = if_else(!is.na(replacement_code),
                                replacement_code, 
                                country_code)) %>% 
  select(-replacement_code)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 gdp_clean_ioc,left_join)

# good enough
results_gdp <- left_join(results_clean, gdp_clean_ioc)

results_gdp %>% 
  relocate(gdp_per_capita, country) %>% 
  visdat::vis_miss()
```
